# PetPals - Java Coding Challenge

Welcome to **PetPals**, a Java-based project developed as part of the **Hexaware Technologies Training Program**. This coding challenge focuses on implementing core Java concepts and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for real-world application development.

## About the Project

**PetPals** is a simple yet powerful system designed to manage pet-related data using Java and database integration. It showcases practical implementation of:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- JDBC for database interaction
- Exception handling
- Layered architecture (entity, dao, util, exception, main module)

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **JDBC**
- **MySQL** (for backend database)
- **Eclipse/IntelliJ** (for development)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

2. Open the project in your IDE.

3. Set up your MySQL database and configure the connection in the utility class.

4. Run the `Main.java` file inside the `mainmod` package.

## Contribution
